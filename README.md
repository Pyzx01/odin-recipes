# odin-recipes
My TOP recipe project repo

First actual project of the odin project.

what i did:

-tried myself how to structure a webpage, creating ordered and unordered lists.
-used different headers and played around with them in the creation process
-incorporated and resized images and links, to my own pages, and to allrecipes
-played around with the over structure
-got myself more used to git (commit,push etc) trying to build good habits of how to comment on commits


while its not pretty its a start :)
